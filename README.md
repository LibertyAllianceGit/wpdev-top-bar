WP Developers | Top Bar
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that allows you to add top notification bars with all sorts of options! You can enable cookies on the close button, change colors, add links and more!

---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Top Bars and select 'Add New' to get started.
